## Step 1: Create an Account

To start using our API, you need to create an account on our platform.

1. Sign Up: Head over to Our Platform and click on the "Sign Up" button.
2. Complete the Form: Fill in the required details such as your name, email, and password. Or sign up with your Google account.
3. Confirm Email: Check your email inbox for a confirmation link to verify your account.

Once your account is confirmed, you’ll be able to access the API dashboard.

## Step 2: Generate Your API Key

1. Log in: Go to API Dashboard and log into your account.
2. Navigate to API Keys: In your dashboard, find the API Keys section under Account Settings.
3. Generate Key: Click on Generate New API Key and store it securely. You’ll need this for all API requests.

<Warning>
  Treat your API key like a password. Do not expose it in client-side code or share it publicly.
</Warning>

Save your API key in a secure location. You will need it to authenticate your requests. Environment variables are a good way to store sensitive information.

```dotenv .env
DEALME_API_KEY=your-api-key
```

### Step 3: Install the SDK

To streamline API usage, we provide SDKs in several programming languages. Choose your preferred environment and follow the installation instructions:

- JavaScript (Node.js) SDK:
```bash
npm install dealme
```

- React SDK:
```bash
npm install @dealme/react
```

If you don't see your preferred language, don't worry you can still use our API. Just follow the [API Reference](/api-reference) to make requests directly.
Our team is working on more SDKs to support a wider range of languages and frameworks.
